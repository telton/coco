* Automated consistency analysis (e.g. Rose)

### Wicked Problems
    * Problems that have more than one solution. 
    * Never just black/white. 
    * You won't know it's a good solution until implementation.
    * No stopping rules.

## Analysis Concepts

* The analysis object model contains _entity, boundary, and control_ objects.

### Objects
* __Entity objects:__ persistent information tracked by the system.
* __Boundary objects:__ interactions between the actors and the system.
* __Control objects:__ tasks that are performed by the user and supported by the system.
